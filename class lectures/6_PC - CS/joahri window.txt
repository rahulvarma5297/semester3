DEFINITION OF JOHARI WINDOW

The term ‘Johari’ was formed by putting together the first two letters of two American psychologists, Joseph Luft and Harry Lingham who developed the idea of self awareness in 1955. The psychologists came up with the model of self awareness based on their experience of the group dynamics prevalent in the university of California.
